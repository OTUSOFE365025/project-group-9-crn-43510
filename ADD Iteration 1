Attribute-Driven Design (ADD) is a step-by-step way to design an architecture starting from using requirements and quality attributes, instead of directly start with low-level code or classes. In this tutorial assignment we are completing 1 iteration of the ADD Process for the cash register system. 
ADD Process Iteration Steps: 
1. Review Input: Examine the use cases, quality attributes, and constraints for this iteration. 
2. Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers 
3. Choose one or more elements of the system to decompose 
4. Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected drivers 
5. Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities and define interfaces 
6. Sketch views and record design decisions 
7. Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives 


##ADD Iteration 1 — AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP)##  

####1. Architectural Drivers####
**1.1 Functional Requirements**

*Key functional drivers:*

R1: Conversational access to institutional data  
R3: Integration with LMS, registration, calendars  
R5–R6: AI model interpretation + response generation  
R7: Cloud-native & scalable  
RS10, RS11: Performance (2 sec response), availability (99.5%)  
RS7: SSO authentication  
RL1–RL2: Lecturer content publishing  
RA1–RA7: Admin integrations, policies, analytics  

**1.2 Quality Attributes**  
*Primary QAs:*

Performance: Avg 2 sec responses (RS10).  
Scalability: 5,000 concurrent users (RA7).  
Availability: 99.5% uptime (RS11).  
Security & Privacy: SSO + role-based access + compliance (RS7, RA5).  
Modifiability: Extending AI models, new APIs (RM5, RM3).  
Interoperability: Standard APIs: REST/GraphQL (RD2).  
Usability: Conversational UI (RS12).
  
**1.3 Constraints**  

Must comply with institutional privacy policies (R8).  
Must integrate with university SSO.  
Must be cloud-deployable (R7).  
Must use standard APIs for all external integration.  
  
####2. Reference Architecture Choice####  
Selected Architecture: Microservices + Event-Driven Architecture (Cloud-Native)
