AIDAP is a conversational assistant for students, lecturers, and administrators. It answers common academic questions, sends reminders, and integrates with university systems (LMS, registration, calendars, email). The assistant uses AI for intent understanding and for generating grounded responses.   
Stakeholders: Students, Lecturers, Administrators, System Maintainer, Data Source Systems.  

AIDAP provides conversational access to institutional data and services (R1), stores interaction history to personalize answers (R2), integrates live university systems (R3), supports text and voice (R4), runs cloud-native and scalable (R7), and protects user data under institutional policy (R8).
