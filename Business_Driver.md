Project: Smart Scheduler (AI-Assisted Student Scheduling Application)
Version: v1.0
Date: 2025-10-27

1) Problem Statement

University students often struggle to balance their academic workload, part-time jobs, and personal commitments across multiple calendars and tools. Existing calendar apps lack intelligent prioritization and holistic scheduling features. As a result, students frequently experience missed deadlines, schedule overlaps, and high stress managing time effectively.

2) Proposed Solution

Smart Scheduler is an intelligent scheduling platform designed for university students. It integrates academic timetables, personal events, and tasks into a unified dashboard. The system uses AI-based prioritization to generate optimized weekly schedules and identify potential conflicts before they occur.

Key highlights:

Seamless integration with Google and Outlook Calendars (via OAuth 2.0).

Automatic detection of class and exam conflicts.

AI-generated task prioritization and suggested study blocks.

Mobile-friendly UI for fast task entry and visualization.

Offline mode for adding tasks without internet connectivity.

3) Stakeholders
Stakeholder	Role / Interest
Students	Primary users who need assistance managing daily schedules, classes, and deadlines.
Academic Advisors	Secondary users who may view or suggest workload balance improvements.
University IT	Integration providers ensuring secure access to institutional timetables.
Development Team	Responsible for implementing, deploying, and maintaining the solution.
Product Manager	Defines roadmap and ensures alignment with business goals.
4) Business Goals and Objectives
Goal	Metric / Target
Improve student productivity	25% reduction in missed deadlines after 2 months of use.
Increase engagement	4+ tasks added per user per week; weekly active rate ≥ 35%.
Reliability & Performance	≥ 99.5% uptime; p95 latency < 400 ms.
Adoption	5,000 registered users within 6 months post-launch.
User Satisfaction	SUS (System Usability Score) ≥ 75 in usability surveys.
5) Business Value

For Students: Saves time, reduces cognitive load, and improves academic success.

For Universities: Promotes digital wellbeing, retention, and performance metrics.

For Developers: Provides opportunities to expand into AI productivity tools and campus integration systems.

For Investors / Stakeholders: Establishes a scalable and monetizable platform for broader productivity markets.

6) Project Scope (v1.0)

In Scope:

Google and Outlook Calendar integration

Import class schedules (CSV/ICS)

AI-assisted weekly planner

Conflict detection and resolution

Notifications and reminders

Basic analytics (e.g., total study hours, overdue tasks)

Out of Scope (Deferred to Future Versions):

Group scheduling

Apple Calendar integration

Advanced AI optimization (machine learning predictions)

Paid subscriptions and monetization features

7) Key Assumptions

Students are willing to authorize limited calendar access via OAuth 2.0.

Universities provide downloadable timetable files (CSV/ICS format).

Users have access to stable internet, except when using offline mode.

Peak load occurs at the start and end of academic terms.

8) Risks and Mitigations
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
Calendar API quota limits	Medium	Implement caching, backoff retries, and scheduled syncs.
Data privacy concerns	High	Follow PIPEDA/GDPR compliance; provide data export/delete options.
AI scheduling bias or errors	Medium	Keep heuristic rule-based AI with explainable reasoning for v1.
Cloud cost overruns	Medium	Apply auto-scaling limits and monitor AWS budget alerts.
Integration failures	Low	Isolate external adapters via Ports and Adapters architecture.
9) Success Criteria
Category	KPI / Success Measure
User Growth	5,000+ users in first 6 months
System Reliability	Uptime ≥ 99.5%
Performance	p95 API latency < 400 ms
AI Scheduling Accuracy	≥ 60% user acceptance of AI suggestions
Customer Satisfaction	SUS ≥ 75
Data Privacy Compliance	Zero unresolved PII incidents
10) High-Level Timeline
Milestone	Deliverables	Target Date
Iteration 1	Authentication, user models, and calendar read integration	Nov 10
Iteration 2	Task creation, prioritization, and conflict detection	Nov 20
Iteration 3	Notifications, UI polishing, accessibility checks	Nov 30
Soft Launch	Beta release with telemetry and bug tracking	Dec 15
11) Expected Outcomes

By the end of development, Smart Scheduler will:

Provide a centralized, intelligent scheduling assistant for students.

Reduce scheduling stress and missed deadlines.

Deliver measurable improvements in time management efficiency.

Establish a scalable foundation for future features like group planning and predictive workload balancing.

12) Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision is to evolve Smart Scheduler into a Campus Productivity Suite — integrating:

Faculty timetable APIs,

Course management (assignments, grades, attendance), and

Predictive analytics that adapt to student habits and energy levels.

This aligns with modern educational technology trends promoting personalized, AI-enhanced learning support.
